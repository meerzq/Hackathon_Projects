## 📖 Overview

**Cybercrime One-Stop Centre** is a secure, centralized platform designed to bridge the gap between the public and cybercrime investigators.

Currently, reporting cybercrime in Malaysia is often confusing, slow, and lacks transparency. Our solution streamlines the entire workflow—from the initial report to investigation and case closure—providing victims with real-time updates and investigators with data-driven insights.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🧑‍💻 For the Public (Reporter Portal)
* **User-Friendly Reporting:** A guided form with image upload capabilities to make reporting fast and accessible.
* **Anonymous Reporting:** Option to submit reports without revealing identity to ensure safety.
* **Real-Time Case Tracking:** View case status (Submitted, Under Review, In Progress, Closed) and investigator updates.
* **AI Assistant (Gemini):** An AI chatbot that answers FAQs and guides users on what evidence is needed.
* **Live Awareness Feed:** Real-time cybercrime news and scam trends via API integration.

### 🕵️‍♂️ For Officers (Investigator Portal)
* **Analytics Dashboard:** Visualized case distribution, priority insights, and trend lines using **Chart.js**.
* **Centralized Case Management:** Sortable case lists by priority, status, or date.
* **Secure Communication Thread:** A forum-like discussion thread with the reporter that preserves an audit trail (replacing WhatsApp/Email).
* **CSV Export:** Ability to export case data for external reporting.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS
* **Backend:** Node.js, JavaScript
* **Database:** Local Storage (Prototype)
* **AI Integration:** Gemini API (Chatbot assistance)
